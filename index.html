      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>Hey! So, what's so great about me that you would want to come to this random website and read about someone you've never met? Well, I'll let you decide that. In all reality, I am not a very excting person. I am very much a homebody, and would prefer to sit around and read or watch a good movie than go and party all night. I know...like I said, I am not a very exciting person.
          But, since you came to my "About Me" page, I guess I had better tell you a little about myself. Here we go.
          I am 29 years old and have lived in Utah my whole life. Yep, I'm that person. I live in a cute little town called Erda, which is neslted in Tooele County.
          I love it here! There's farm land and mountains, not a lot of people, and the view is amazing.
          I have two beautiful girls, one is six and just started first grade this year, and I have a four year old who thinks she is going on 18.
          It's one heck of a ride, but I wouldn't have it any other way. 
      </p>

      <p>How did I get interested in code? That is a story in and of itself. No, I'm kidding. Once again, I'm boring, so this story isn't going to be very exciting. So, Once Upon a Time, I was trying to get onto a website, but one of the buttons wouldn't work, which was then preventing me from continuing my registration on this particular website, so I right clicked the screen and saw "Inspect" at the bottom. Not knowing what this was, I clicked on it, and it brought me into a scramble of letters. I realized that this was code and was telling the website what to do. I found the code for the button I was trying to use and saw that the function was disabled, so I changed the wording, hoping this would get it to work. 
          Low and behold...it worked! I was so excited. I literally got up and did a little jig. At that moment I didn't think, "Hmmm, maybe I should become a web developer", I honestly don't remember my exact thought, but I know it wasn't that. It wasn't until a year later that I was driving through Draper, Utah and saw a ton of billboards advertising work for coding. I couldn't stop thinking about it, and a few months later, I started researching places that taught code. I needed something that was cheap, so I started with FreeCodingCamp. It was informational, but I felt like I wasn't really committed, and I wasn't learning in the best way. And due to my recent divorce, I needed something that would allow me to have 
          reliable work that also paid well. That's when I started researching actual schools. As I was searching, the first search query that I found was for the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. 
          I looked into it, started talking to some couselors, and long story short...here I am, learning to code like a boss!
